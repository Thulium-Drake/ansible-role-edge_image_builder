### Deployment server
# The following variables are used to configure a simple DHCP/TFTP setup
# which can be used to deploy a server that can PXEboot target devices for
# the images built by this server
#
# NOTE: It assumes it has complete control over the subnet it's connected to!
#
# * The DHCP range is configured from <subnet>.20 to <subnet>.50
# * The PXELinux config file needs to be generated manually, see the examples
#   directory for more information
